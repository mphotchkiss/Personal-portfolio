# My Personal Portfolio

A node.js react.js web application built to host my professional resume, portfolio of work, information, and external links.

## What I learned

### React.js
- component lifecycle & lifecycle methods
- lifting state
- function components
- utilizing API requests in mounting

## How to use

run `npm start` to spin up locally

An internet connection is required to communicate with the GitHub API for the portfolio section - no auth required
